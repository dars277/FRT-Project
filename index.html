              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.
            </p>
            <p>
              A coronavirus is a kind of common virus that causes an infection in your nose, sinuses, or upper throat. 
              Most coronaviruses aren't dangerous.
              In early 2020, after a December 2019 outbreak in China, the World Health Organization identified SARS-CoV-2 
              as a new type of coronavirus. 
              The outbreak quickly spread around the world.
              COVID-19 is a disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 that can trigger what doctors call a respiratory tract infection. 
              It can affect your upper respiratory tract (sinuses, nose, and throat) or lower respiratory tract (windpipe and lungs).
            </p>     
            <p>
              The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles 
              when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger 
              respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, 
              for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you 
              recover if you feel unwell.
              
            </p> 
            <p>
              The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the 
              disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying 
              at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands 
              or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow 
              local guidance.
            </p>

              Coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>WHY ONE SHOULD GET VACCINATED ? </strong>
              <br>
              Vaccines save millions of lives each year and a COVID-19 vaccine could save yours. The COVID-19
              vaccines are safe and effective, providing strong protection against serious illness and death. WHO reports that unvaccinated people have at least 10 times higher risk of death from COVID-19 than someone who has been vaccinated. 
              It is important to be vaccinated as soon as it’s your turn, even if you already had COVID-19. Getting vaccinated is a safer way for you to develop immunity from COVID-19 than getting infected.
              The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective, but no vaccine provides 100 per cent protection. Some people will still get ill from COVID-19 after vaccination or pass the virus onto someone else. 
              Therefore, it is important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others, including avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing and wearing a mask.
            </p> 

            <p>
            <strong>WHICH COVID-19 VACCINE IS BEST FOR ME ?</strong>
            <br>
            All WHO-approved vaccines have been shown to be highly effective at protecting you against severe illness and death from COVID-19. The best vaccine to get is the one most readily 
            available to you.You can find a list of those approved vaccines on WHO’s site.Remember, if your vaccination involves two doses, it’s important to receive both to have the maximum protection. 
            Additional doses (boosters) may be recommended by your local health authority for specific groups. 
            </p> 

            <p>
            <strong>ARE COVID-19 VACCINES SAFE ?</strong>
            <br>
            COVID-19 vaccines have been safely used to vaccinate billions of people. The COVID-19 vaccines were developed as rapidly as possible, but they all must go through rigorous testing 
            in clinical trials to prove that they meet internationally agreed benchmarks for safety and effectiveness. Only if they meet these standards can a vaccine receive validation from 
            WHO and national regulatory agencies.UNICEF will only procure and supply COVID-19 vaccines that meet WHO’s established safety and efficacy criteria and that have received the required 
            regulatory approval.
            </p>

            <P>
            <strong>CAN I STOP TAKING PRECAUTION AFTER BEING VACCINATED ?</strong>
            <br>
            Keep taking precautions to protect yourself, family and friends if there is still COVID-19 in your area, even after getting vaccinated. The COVID-19 vaccines are highly effective against serious
            illness and death, but no vaccine is 100% effective.The vaccines offer less protection against infection from the Omicron variant, which is now the dominant variant globally, but remain highly
            effective in preventing hospitalization, severe disease, and death. In addition to vaccination, it remains important to continue practicing safety precautions to protect yourself and others. 
            These precautions include avoiding crowded spaces, physical distancing, hand washing, and wearing a mask (as per local policies).  
            </P>

            <P>
            <strong>HOW CAN I PROTECT MY FAMILY UNTIL WE ARE ALL VACCINATED ?</strong> 
            <br>
            Safe and effective vaccines are a game changer, but even once vaccinated we need to continue taking precautions for the time being to protect ourselves and others. Variants like Omicron have proven that although COVID-19 vaccines are very effective at preventing severe disease, they’re not enough to stop the spread of the virus alone. The most important thing you can do is reduce your risk of exposure to the virus. To protect yourself and your loved ones, make sure to:

            Wear a mask where physical distancing from others is not possible.
            Keep a physical distance from others in public places.
            Avoid poorly ventilated or crowded spaces.
            Open windows to improve ventilation indoors.
            Try and focus on outdoor activities if possible.  
            Wash your hands regularly with soap and water or an alcohol-based hand rub.
            If you or a family member has a fever, cough or difficulty breathing, seek medical care early and avoid mixing with other children and adults.

              present the numbers in a way that’s as easy to understand as possible.
              With live reporting, analytics from different sources are all presented through the one dashboard. 
              That means clients can access all their data from just one place. Gone are the days of having to
